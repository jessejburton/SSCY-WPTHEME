<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>Yoga Instruction and Liability Waiver and Release</p>

<p>I understand that yoga is an ancient Indian system designed to make the body strong and flexible. I realise that it is important never to do any practice to the point of pain or discomfort. I am aware that there is some risk involved in all physical exercise and that I am responsible for recognising my own physical limits.</p>

<p>I understand that yoga is not a substitute for medical attention, examination, diagnosis or treatment, and that practising yoga is not recommended and is not safe under certain medical conditions. If I have any concerns about whether yoga is suitable for me or if I have a particular injury or medical condition, I will consult my physician before participating in a yoga class.</p>

<p>I hereby agree to irrevocably waive, release and discharge any and all claims and liabilities against the Salt Spring Centre of Yoga, its individual instructors or staff, and/or Dharma Sara Satsang Society for any personal injury, death or damage to the person or property.</p>

<p>By checking this box and entering your name you agree to all of the terms and conditions listed above. Please read the terms carefully.</p>
